The first fold is treated as a validation set, and the machine learning algorithm is trained on the remaining `k-1` folds. The mean squared error is then computed on the held-out fold. This procedure is repeated k times; each time, a different group of observations is treated as a validation set.\n",

When we applied the feature selection we used information from both the training set and the test sets used for the cross validation, i.e. the correlation values. As a consequence our LogisticRegression knew information in the test sets that were supposed to be hidden to it. In fact, when you are computing $MSE_i$ in the i-th iteration of the cross validation you should be using only the information on the training fold, and nothing should come from the test fold. In our case the model did indeed have information from the test fold, i.e. the top correlated features. I think the term **knowledge leaking** express this concept fairly well. \n",

    "## Cross validation done right\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section we have seen that if you inject test knowledge in your model your cross validation procedure will be biased. To avoid this let's compute the features correlation during each cross validation batch. The difference is that now the features correlation will use only the information in the training fold instead of the entire dataset. That's a key insight causing the bias we saw previously. The following graph shows you the revisited procedure. This time we got a realistic $\\hat{MSE}$ of $0.53$ that confirms the data is randomly distributed.\n",

    "\n",
    "We have seen how doing features engineering at the wrong step when using cross validation can terribly bias the `MSE` estimate of your machine learning algorithm. We have also seen how to correctly apply cross validation by simply moving one step down the feature engineering such that the knowledge from the test data does not leak in our learning procedure. If you want know more about cross validation and the its tradeoffs both R. Kohavi and Y. Bengio with Y. Grandvalet wrote on this topic.\n"
